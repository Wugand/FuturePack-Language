	"During the experiment of purposely interrupting or re-routing Neon currents, I got the idea I could build more complex control systems with that.",
	"For the time being, deliberately contaminated silicon wafers happen to be the the ideal base material. From these, I could develop an universal base component, which I call a transistor.",
	"They operate fairly easily, there's an input and an output, which are usually separated. Though if I use a current to create a forcefield at a control-input, the material changes so that in- and output become connected.",
	"With enough of these parts, I could presumably realize every form of logic and controls. First I have to develop a suitable crafting station.",
