  "According to my calculations, I would fly very long to reach another planet, because I can not fly with ifinite speed. So I searched for other possibilities to move. With the teleportation of the enderpearls in mind, I created a new drive, which manipulates space itself to create a shortcut to the destination.",
  "This process needs a lot of power and is only possible with a special machine I named FTL-Drive. It is build with 12 FTL-Blocks, a 2x3 foundation and 2 Blocks tall. After all 12 components are placed, I can assemble the final drive. (connects automatic)",
  "I have to install this drive in every spaceship, if I wish to fly further than Menelaus.",
