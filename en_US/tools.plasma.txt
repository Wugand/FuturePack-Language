"It takes a lot of time to break down metal blocks with a pickaxe, also it is very
 inefficient. That's why I developed a tool that, similar to a bunsen burner, creates
much heat to melt metals. For steel or iron is a bigger amount of energy needed though,
that's why a super hot plasma ray is used. This is created by ionizing the surrounding air
and heating it up by dischargings. This process however needs a lot of energy.",
"To prevent the big heat from destroying everything a magnetic field is created, 
it may be useful to check that there's enough energy for its creation though.",
