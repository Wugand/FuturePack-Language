    "My simple board computer is unfortunately not able to calculate the paths for the FTL-Drive. Because despite the processing unit in the FTL even more accurate data for control and course calculation is needed, and I have to compensate (in)logic and effects of quantum mechanics. That's why I created an upgrade and used a powerfull quantum computer as cpu.",
    "I also fixed some problems the first version had. For example the message 'Your spaceship is open' also points out were it is open."
