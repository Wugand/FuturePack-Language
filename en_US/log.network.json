	"I determined during my research that it can be very difficult to connect all modules with the reseracher.",
	"That is why I implemented a simple idea for a network. The machines are connected with each other and can communicate.",
	"The researcher, scanner and the modules can all be connected via the network and therefore don't have to be located in the same location anymore. This enables me to build large storage rooms while still being able to connect them all with the researcher."
