	"I improved the simple Industrial Furnace with my newest technologies. Now it consumes Neon-Energy and got an upgradable computer system.",
	"The Neon Industrial Furnace is featured with some sensors and precisely controllable heating coils. So it can perfectly control the smelting process.",
	"With this new abilities I was also able to renew my old recipes, to make them more efficient. (all Recipes are listed in the following Researches)",
	"I am sure, that there are more functions that I can apply to the machine. Also I have integrated a system for consumption of support points, which I can use in complex recipes.",
