	"I came to the close that small quartzcrystals can be used as both a clock generator and for permanent storage of input information alike.",
	"In combination with some controlling logic, as well as silicon and some energy conductors made from copper I developed an universal chipset, which mainly functions as a bridge between processor and outside world.",
	"Further, this logic chipset contains basic code for the processor, which allows the system to boot. So for the time being, every system will need one of these chipsets.",
