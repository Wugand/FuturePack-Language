	"I managed to create a machine with my basic knowledge of chip-crafting, which gives me ideal conditions for assembling these components.",
	"The main part is made up of a metal frame with various pieces of machinery for assembly and testing. Additionally, the facility makes it possible to perform the crucial steps of assembly in a very clean environment, which has proven to be imperative for the success of the component.",

	"Usage:",
	"An item created here always consists of 3 components, which are placed in the central 3 slots. Their order is of importance! The finished product can be taken from the big slot beneath.",
	
	"At random:",
	"Although the surroundings are optimal, the quality of the actual component can't be fully predicted. That being said, upon assembly a random value for core/ram/chippower gets created. A minimum value is set by the recipe used.",
	"The maximum value usually is only slightly higher than minimum, but can be increased noticeably by supplying energy and/or Support (becomes available with further research).",
	"Note: There are situations and recipes in which supplied energy/Support gets wasted or isn't wanted."
