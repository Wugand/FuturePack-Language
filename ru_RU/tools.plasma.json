	"It takes a lot of time to break down metal blocks with a pickaxe, as well as it being very inefficient. That's why I developed a tool that, similar to a bunsen burner, creates sufficient heat to melt metals.",
	"For steel or iron, a larger amount of energy is needed. That's why a super-hot plasma ray is used. This is created by ionizing the surrounding air and heating it up by discharging all at once. This process needs a lot of energy, however.",
	"To prevent the extreme heat from breaking everything down, a magnetic field is created. It may be useful to check that there's enough energy for its creation though.",
