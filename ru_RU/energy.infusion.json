	"The local crystals can cause considerable damage to biological organisms. During further analysis I noticed that the crystals have a special interaction with organic materials. In this process the organic structures as well as the crystal structures degenerate, this causes the emission of some energy.",
	"Using this principle I designed a generator which injects crystal fragments into food or burnable materials (not Lava or Coal). The produced heat can simply be cast into neon energy. As a waste product the machine produces a fine Neon Crystal Dust.",
