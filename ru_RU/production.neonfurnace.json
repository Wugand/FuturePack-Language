	"A coil conducting a high amount of energy is going to heat up. I can use this principle to build an energy powered furnace, by adding a computer system that regulates the energy flow. So I can generate the maximum amount of heat without destroying the heating coils. With upgrades this type of furnace should be really powerful.",
