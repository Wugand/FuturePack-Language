	"During the extraction of various materials I noticed that the extracts of the rare earths exhibt several stable forms. For my further experiments I chose Gadolinium for which I was able to discover 5 stable isoptopes. The state change can also be triggered by targeted exposure which I generate with a complicated control system that is based on the crystal structure of emeralds. Since I have cells with 5 states at my disposal I can store significantly more data overall.",
